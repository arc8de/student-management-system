Step 1: Code Quality

	- Check for code duplication, unnecessary complexity, and adherence to coding standards.

	- Ensure that the code is well-commented and readable.

	- Use a code formatter to maintain consistent code style.

Step 2: Code Coverage

	- Run the unit tests and check the code coverage using a tool like Junit.

	- Aim for at least 70% code coverage for the service and DAO layers.

Step 3: Dependency Management

	- Review the pom.xml file to ensure that all dependencies are correctly managed.

	- Remove any unused dependencies and update outdated ones.

Step 4: Security Review

	- Check for any potential security vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).

	- Ensure that user inputs are properly validated and sanitized.

Step 5: Performance Optimization

	- Identify any performance bottlenecks in the code.

	- Optimize database queries and reduce unnecessary computations.
